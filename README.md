# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System-using-AI-Agents
This project is a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using MESA and OpenCV. It monitors eye blinks to assess alertness and triggers an audible alert if drowsiness is detected. Using dlib for facial landmarks and Pygame for audio alerts, it enhances driver safety by preventing fatigue-related accidents.
